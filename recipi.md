This chocolate vanilla cake is all that. The vanilla layer is light,
 fluffy and super moist while the chocolate layer resembles the brownie cracked top with bites of melted chocolate here and there.
  A perfect balance!

  you only need to bake one cake to feed crowd. 1 hour tops from pantry to table.

Just like for most of the cakes, you’ll need butter, sugar, eggs, vanilla, buttermilk, flour and chocolate.
efore you start you have to make sure your ingredients are at room temperature, especially the butter, eggs and milk. This will ensure the ingredients will combine easily without overheating the batter.

If you forgot to take them out of the fridge ahead of time, you can quick soften the butter by either grating it or cheating and use the microwave for 5-10 seconds. You can do the same with the milk.

To quickly bring the eggs to room temperature, place them in a bowl with warm water for about 5 minutes of so. Do not cook them! 
Start by creaming the butter with the sugar. That should take about 3 minutes. The lightness of the cake depends on this step. You have to make sure the butter and sugar are well combined before adding in the eggs.

Alternately beat in the milk and the flour.

Spoon the batter into a baking pan and drop spoonfuls of melted chocolate on top of it. With a fork or a butter knife make a couple of swirls combining the chocolate with the vanilla cake batter.

Bake until a toothpick comes out clean, about 40 minutes. Cool slightly and enjoy!
